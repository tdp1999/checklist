# Checklist

With the desire to keep the best practices, check the semantic errors in the code and create my own coding style, I created this project.

Basically, this is just a very simple project checklist, or to-do list, that anyone can do. However, with my little experience, it took me quite a while for some of the parts that I tried for the first time, such as building a RESTful API server for this project.
